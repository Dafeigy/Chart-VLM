# chartVLM

Figures translate to Echarts. Built with Vue3 + Tailwindcss + Elementplus. A coding toy written in 2025.07.20.

Thanks to Siliconflow, now I can easily use VLM models with low latency. You can registed with my invitation code by clicking [my invitation link](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/9CZQzRc8).

The model I used is `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct`. You can try something like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct` with a little higher price.

PROMPT can be found in `src\components\debugger.vue`. Feel free to optimize it.
